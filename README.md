## How to Deploy

Since this is a static website (HTML/CSS/JS), it can be deployed instantly for free on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

### Option 1: Netlify (Drag & Drop) - Easiest

1.  Go to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
2.  Drag the **entire `Brimarc_Global` folder** onto the page.
3.  Netlify will process the files and give you a live URL (e.g., `mystifying-galaxy-12345.netlify.app`).
4.  (Optional) Go to "Site Settings" to change the site name or connect a custom domain.

### Option 2: Vercel (via Git) - Best for Updates

1.  Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2.  Log in to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and click "Add New... > Project".
3.  Import your GitHub repository.
4.  Vercel will detect it as a static site. Click **Deploy**.
5.  Your site will be live instantly.

## Local Development

To run this locally without deployment:

1.  Install a simple server extension (like "Live Server" for VS Code).
2.  Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
3.  Or simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser (though some strict browser security settings might block local script modules, mostly it works fine).
